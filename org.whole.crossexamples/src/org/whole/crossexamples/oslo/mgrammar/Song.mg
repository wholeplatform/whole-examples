/*
    The Song language allows a songwriter to compose a song 
    that starts with "Music" and is followed by zero or more "-"
    characters or characters for the range of notes "Ab" to "G#",
    delimited by the "," character.
    
    Additionally, whitespace characters can now be included in
    input and will be ignored during processing unless the
    RestOrNote token rule is being matched.

    Finally, a song is defined as having zero or more bars where each bar
    contains a combination of four rests and notes.
